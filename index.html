            <h1>Dear Girl,</h1>
            <p>As I write this note, I am thinking back over this project that has been in and out of my mind since last year's anniversary.  I saved this part for last because it's so hard to think of the right thing to say.  I almost wanted to show this to you early after our less than stellar Mothers' Day, but I don't think it actually would have made anything better.  You know how much I struggle with these things, and I wanted to let you know that I'm trying, but <i>trying</i> just isn't the same as <i>showing</i>.</p>
            <p>Below is a collection of <i>snapshots</i> - both literal and figurative - from each year of our marriage.  I tried the best as I could to do each year justice.  Some years were easier to think back to than others, and some certainly evoked some clear memories and emotions.  I know that they will for you as well.  This project has also been a great source of self-reflection for me and has done a lot to help me through these past few months.  And I have certainly never been as appreciative of the pictures that you have taken as I am right now!</p>

                <h1>2008</h1>
                <p>As I thought all the way back to this year it occurred to me just how amazing and remarkable this time was.  Wedding aside, I had just finished my bachelors degree and was starting a <i>real</i> job, making <i>real</i> money and were looking forward to starting a new chapter of our lives together.  In some sense the wedding didn't matter much to me because I had already known for some time that we would be together forever.  But thinking back on it now it was a very notable starting point for our journey.</p>

                <h1>2009</h1>
                <p>One year in, I was finished with school and we were getting ready to grow our family.  We were living with Mike and Corbin and I distinctly remember us spending a lot of time apart with you taking freqeunt, long trips to Michigan.  It's interesting to reflect on how much we were still figuring each other out.  I know it's kind of cliche, but I'm certain that I took our free time for granted in these days and I wish that I had put more effort in to creating experiences together.</p>

                <p>It won't surprise you to know that before I met you I didn't give much thought to having children.  I was nervous, uncertain, and directionless, but you were -and still are - my guiding light. Your desire to have children was infectious and had a big impact on me.  You made me want to be a good dad.  I think I've done pretty well so far, and I have no regrets.</p>

                <p>Moving to Michigan was yet another huge milestone in our relationship, and that first year living in Okemos and working at LCC was so exciting and full of promise.  I was so excited for you to go back to school!  To this day I am convinced we made the right choice and that we are where we are supposed to be thanks to this change.  For all the stress and drama which has followed this year, we are still happier and healthier than we would have been otherwise.</p>

                <p>And although I did struggle to find pictures of <i>you</i> for this year, I am still so damn proud for what you did while earning your associates degree.  You will never convince me it was a mistake.  The experience helped shape you as a person and taught you that you are capable of more than what you think.  I hope that you will never stop trying to do more.</p>

                <p>Half-way there!  It may sound weird to hear this after the fact but I think it was somewhere in this timeframe that I actually started to think of myself as a husband and father.  It was a big shift for me to start really putting you and James first.  I know that I've come to appreciate you more and more as a partner and to believe that we're actually doing a good job at this whole family thing.</p>

                <p>In the span of one month you graduated, we went to Chicago, and SageLink closed down.  I know that things didn't work out the way you had hoped but we have thrived none-the-less.  Lots of questions about our future were raised this year, but I remained confident and comfortable that we could overcome it all together.</p>

As unsure as I was, I have no regrets at all and I feel truly fortunate that we decided to have Luke right when we did.  This was a difficult year for us for so many reasons, and I remember so many nights and days where I wished that I could change things, but the happiness that this joyful little boy gives us now was well worth it.</p>

                <h1>2017</h1>
                <p>I won't try to sugarcoat it: we have both had a difficult year, and we have let it affect each other and the boys.  Some days I still feel like my grasp of reality is slipping.  Some days I feel like we are tumbling slowly in to poverty or despair.  Some days I even feel like we are drifting ever so slowly away from each other and it makes me want to cry out for you and cling to your side.</p>
                <p>But the truth is that even though so many things are changing and evolving,  we still love each other deeply and nothing will change that.  Although we are being challenged like never before, we are also both stronger than we have ever been.  Just like every year passed, we will come out the other side wiser and more committed to a brighter future.</p>

            <h1>And now...</h1>
            <p>At the start of our 11th year of marriage, we have more to look forward to now that ever before.  So let's be realistic about it; Things never work out exactly like we want them to, but things get just a bit better with every step we take.  The key is that we have to take these steps together (and sometimes dragging our boys kicking and screaming behind us).</p>
            <p>So in lieu of a big present or party for our tenth anniversary I hope you will accept this digital momento, and another upcoming weekend of wonderful family memories.</p>
            <p>Sincerely, Boy</p>
