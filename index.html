            <h1>2008</h1>
            <p>In the past few weeks as I have been thinking back to this year I have often been fixated on just how amazing and remarkable this time was.  Wedding aside, I had just finished my bachelors degree and was starting a <i>real</i> job, making <i>real</i> money and were looking forward to starting a new chapter of our lives together.  In some sense, the wedding didn't matter much to me because I had already known for some time that we would be together forever.  But thinking back on it now, it was a very notable starting point for our journey.</p>

            <h1>2009</h1>
            <p>One year in, I was finished with school and we were getting ready to grow our family.  We were living with Mike and Corbin and I distinctly remember us spending a lot of time apart, with you taking freqeunt, long trips to Michigan.  In retrospect, it's interesting to see now how much we were still figuring each other out.  I know it's kind of cliche, but I'm certain I took our free time for granted in these days.</p>

            <p>It won't surprise you to know that before I met you I didn't give much thought to having children.  In some sense, without your influence in my life I had no direction so your desire to have children young was infectious and had a big impact on me.  As nervous and uncertain as I was, you were my guiding light.  While that is true for much of ours lives together, it was never more impactful than when we had James.  You made me want to be a good dad.  I think I've done pretty well.  I have no regrets.</p>

            <p>Moving to Michigan was yet another telling milestone in our relationship, and that first year living in Okemos and working at LCC was so exciting and full of promise.  I was so excited for you to go back to school!  To this day, I am convinced we made the right choice and that we are where we are supposed to be thanks to this change.  For all the stress and drama which has followed this year, we are still happier and healthier than we would have been otherwise.</p>

            <p>I am so damn proud for what you did while earning your associates degree, you will never convince me it was a mistake.  The experience helped shape you as a person and taught you that you are capable of more than what you think.  I hope that you will never stop trying to do more.</p>

            <p>Half-way there!  It may sound scary/weird to hear this after the fact, but I think it was somewhere in this timeframe that I actually started to think of myself as a husband and father.  I know that I've come to appreciate you more and more as a partner and to believe that we're actually doing a good job at this whole family thing.</p>
